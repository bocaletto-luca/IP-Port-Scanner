## Key Features

- **IP Scanning:** Users can specify a range of IP addresses and initiate a scan to gather information about hosts within the network.

- **Port Scanning:** After selecting a host from the resulting list, users can perform a port scan to determine which ports are open or closed on that host.

- **Simple User Interface:** The application offers an intuitive user interface with buttons to start, stop, and view scan results.

- **Detailed Results:** Scan results are displayed in a tree structure with detailed information about IP addresses, hostnames, and port statuses.

## Usage

1. Specify a range of IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1-192.168.1.254) in the provided input box.

2. Start the IP scan to discover hosts within the network.

3. Select a host from the resulting list.

4. Specify a range of ports (e.g., 1-1024) in the provided input box.

5. Start the port scan to check the status of ports on that host.

6. Port scan results will be displayed in the tree structure.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, Tkinter, which is typically included with Python distributions, is required.
